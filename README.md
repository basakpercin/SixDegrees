The program takes artists.txt which includes the artist names and songs. Program
creates a collaboration graph using this input, in which vertices are artists 
and edges are the collaboration songs. Using 4 user given commands (bfs, dfs, 
not and quit) either from command line or from a command file, bfs prints the 
shortest path between 2 artists, dfs prints a path between 2 artists, not 
function takes in 2 artists and a list of artists to be excluded and prints the 
shortest path and the collaborated songs between given 2 artists excluding the 
artists in exclude list. Quit, exists the program. If there is no path between 
the 2 artists, program prints a message stating there is no path. If any of the 
artists is not in the graph, program prints a message stating artist X is not 
in the dataset. Output will be written to either an output file or to the 
standard output stream.
